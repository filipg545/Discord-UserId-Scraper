A simple script taking use of Discord.PY to scrape the user id's of members in a certain discord guild.

## Bot token
First thing you will want to do is create a 'Bot Token' which can be created here: https://discord.com/developers/applications. Then you will want to enable a couple of Priviliged Gateway Intents, specifically PRESENCE INTENT, PRESENCE INTENT, and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT as the code will throw errors otherwise. You can see the intents enable in the image below.
